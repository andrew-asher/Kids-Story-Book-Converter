# Story Bee - Kids Storybook Converting App

Story Bee is an innovative platform that revolutionizes children's reading experiences by converting traditional storybooks into engaging digital formats. The app leverages advanced machine learning models to create a comprehensive storytelling experience, combining text, audio, and visual elements.

## Project Overview

Story Bee is designed to foster children's reading habits in the digital age. It integrates multiple machine learning techniques to enhance the storytelling experience, making it more interactive and engaging for young readers.

### Key Features:

- **Abstractive Text Summarization:** Utilizes advanced abstractive summarization techniques to identify and focus on the most interesting parts of a story, ensuring that the plot is engaging for young audiences.
  
- **Text-to-Audio Conversion:** Converts selected story text into audio, adding background music and offering different voice options to cater to diverse preferences.
  
- **Image Generation:** Generates images that align with the story's content, creating a visual narrative to accompany the text and audio.
  
- **Keyword and Sentiment Extraction:** Extracts key terms and analyzes the sentiment of the story, enabling a more nuanced storytelling experience.

### Research Contributions:

- **Unique Storybook Dataset:** Crafted a specialized dataset containing a wide range of children's stories, tailored to enhance the abstractive summarization model.
  
- **Advanced LSTM Model:** Implemented an advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for comprehensive text processing, ensuring accurate and meaningful story summarizations.
  
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuned the models with custom datasets, focusing on capturing emotional nuances and strategically selecting optimal approaches to ensure project success.
